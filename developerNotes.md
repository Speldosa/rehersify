# To-do
* Should there be stereo panning for the rehersal files as well? Maybe, but to a lesser degree.
* Create a program that sorts the output into separate folders. Maybe.
* Write a better and more comprehensive README with instructions of how to export sound files from popular DAWs and more. Include screenshots.
* Conform to the GitHub standard of writing README files. (What special functions can I use?)
* Create a helper program that rename the files for you or places them in folders. Maybe I should implement some kind of folder looking instead of just having everything in on big inputfolder. Hmm...
* Create better and more sensible handling of input from terminal.
* When done, update the thread on Stack Exchange and link to the package.
* Create files without certain voices.
* Create stereo output. Might take some work.
* Make it so that it's possible to choose between passing values to the proram and just go with the default values. Se [http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_command_line_arguments.htm](this) homepage.
* Check out if you can implement ogg vorbis support, for example with tags and stuff.
* Find segments where two or more voices are exactly the same. Mute all but one voice here. This would be nice, but it would probably take A LOT of time to implement (not even sure if Sox could help me here).
